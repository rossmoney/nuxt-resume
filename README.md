My CV, built with [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/installation) and
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): https://www.rossmoney.me (or

## Data

All of the content of this CV is sourced from
[`resume-data.json`](./resume-data.json). This file loosely adheres to the
[`resume.json` schema](https://jsonresume.org/schema/) (with some additional
properties for display purposes). See the [resume.json](#resumejson) section
below for more info about `resume.json` compatibility.

Additionally, a `resume-data.private.json` file can be created alongside
[`resume-data.json`](./resume-data.json). This file is `.gitignore`-ed; its
contents will be merged into [`resume-data.json`](./resume-data.json) when
building this CV. This is used to protect personal info such as phone
numbers and addresses, while still allowing this data to appear in
locally-generated CVs.

## Inspiration

This project's visual style was heavily inspired by the [Universal CV
Template](https://universal-resume-pages.netlify.com/).

## resume.json

As part of the CI pipeline, a `resume.json` file that conforms to the
[`resume.json` schema](https://jsonresume.org/schema/) is extracted from
[`resume-data.json`](./resume-data.json) and automatically pushed to a [GitHub
Gist](https://gist.github.com/rossmoney/2d5585729373bcc933c34d8e5c28a0b2). The
[`ci/generate-resume.json.js`](./ci/generate-resume.json.js) script is
responsible for this work.

You can view the rendered result at https://registry.jsonresume.org/rossmoney.

## Generating a CV locally

To generate a CV locally, simply start the dev server (`yarn dev`) and print
the web page (<kbd>⌘</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>) as a PDF. In fact, this
is exactly how the PDF is generated by the pipeline. Since the pipeline uses
[headless
Chrome](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkgr/headless/README.md#headless-chromium),
printing the CV locally using Chrome will provide the most consistent
result.

### Why not just use the PDF generated by the pipeline?

The pipeline generates a PDF using only the public information found in
[`resume-data.json`](./resume-data.json) and does not include any private data
specified in `resume-data.private.json`. (For example, phone numbers.)

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For other useful commands, check out the `scripts` defined in
[`package.json`](./package.json).

### HTML linting

One `yarn` script in particular - `yarn html-lint` - requires some setup before
it will run:

- Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
- Install [Bundler](https://bundler.io/)
- Run `bundle install` at the root of this project
- Run `yarn generate` to generate a production build in `./dist`

Once these prerequisites have been completed, running `yarn html-lint` will run
[`html-proofer`](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer) on the output
`*.html`. This is particularly useful for validating that all external links are
still valid.

### Static generation

During deployment, all Nuxt-related `<script>` elements are stripped from the
compiled HTML. This is accomplished by the `yarn strip-scripts` command, which
calls [`ci/strip-script-elements.js`](ci/strip-script-elements.js). This works
because this application is fully rendered at build time and requires no
client-side hydration.

Stripping these `<script>` elements allows the end result to be truly static (no
JavaScript required), which isn't
([yet](https://github.com/nuxt/rfcs/issues/22)) supported by Nuxt.
